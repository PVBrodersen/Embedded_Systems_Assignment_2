# Embedded_Systems_Assignment_2
File storage for Assignment 2 in Embedded systems

# Guidance
Please create directories for the seperate parts of the project. I.E. create a directory for vivado, vitis, ros, etc. 

If you are using VScode, you may experience an error regarding include files. To fix this open c_cpp_properties.json file, and add the following line of code after "${workspaceFolder}/**" on line 6: "/opt/ros/foxy/include/**"

!!! IMPORTANT THAT YOU MAKE SURE TO COMMA SEPERATE YOUR includePath ARGUMENTS !!!
